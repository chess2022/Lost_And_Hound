<h1>About </h1>
<p>Lost And Hound was founded in 2022 by Cheryl, Javier, and Kelly, a group of software engineers looking for a way to consolidate information about lost and found pets. Their goal is to create a free interactive online database for lost and found reports where worried pet owners and good Samaritans could connect quickly and efficiently.</p>
